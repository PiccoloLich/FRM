\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Overview}
\begin{block}{Concepts}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Risk}: uncertainty regarding losses/gain.
\item \textbf{Risk management}: Activities aimed to reduce eliminate potential to incur expected loses.
\item \textbf{Risk trading}: taking risk $\to$ generating incremental gains
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Risk management process}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify 
\item Quantify and estimate
\item Determine collective effects/cost-benefit analysis
\item Develop risk mitigation strategy
\item Assess performance and amend risk mitigation strategy as needed
\end{enumerate}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Tools and procedures}
\begin{itemize}
\item Quantitative measures: \textit{e.g.} VaR, Expected shortfall, Exposures\footnote{Will re-visit}  
\item Quantitative assessment: scenario analysis, stress testing, 
\item Enterprise risk management (ERM): integrative approach within an entire entity
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Compare}
\begin{itemize}
