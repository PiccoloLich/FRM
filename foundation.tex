\section{Foundations of risk management}


\subsection{Overview}

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Overview}
\begin{block}{Concepts}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Risk}: uncertainty regarding losses/gain.
\item \textbf{Risk management}: Activities aimed to reduce eliminate potential to incur expected loses.
\item \textbf{Risk trading}: taking risk $\to$ generating incremental gains
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Risk management process}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify 
\item Quantify and estimate
\item Determine collective effects/cost-benefit analysis
\item Develop risk mitigation strategy
\item Assess performance and amend risk mitigation strategy as needed
\end{enumerate}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Tools and procedures}
\begin{itemize}
\item Quantitative measures: \textit{e.g.} VaR, Expected shortfall, Exposures\footnote{Will re-visit}  
\item Quantitative assessment: scenario analysis, stress testing, 
\item Enterprise risk management (ERM): integrative approach within an entire entity
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Compare}
\begin{itemize}
\item Expected \& unexpected loss
\item Risk \& reward
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Types of risks}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Market risk: \textit{e.g.} IR, FX, equity, commodity price, \textit{etc}
		\item Credit risk: \textit{e.g.} default, bankruptcy, downgrade and settlement
		\item Liquidity risk: \textit{e.g.} funding/trading liquidity risk
		\item Operation risk: non-financial problems; challenging to quantify
		\item Legal and regulatory risk
		\item Business risk: uncertainty in business environment (supply/demand, business strategy)
		\item Strategic risk: associated with large new business investments
		\item Reputation risk
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Sample question}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Examining the impact of a dramatic increase in interest rates on the
value of a bond investment portfolio could be performed using which of the
following tools?
	\begin{enumerate}[I]
		\item Stress testing
		\item Enterprise risk management
	\end{enumerate}
    \begin{enumerate}[A]
    	\item I only
    	\item II only
    	\item both I and II
    	\item Neither I nor II
    \end{enumerate}
	\item In considering the major classes of risks, which risk would best describe
an entity with weak internal controls that could easily be circumvented with a
lack of segregation of duties?
	\begin{enumerate}[A]
		\item Business risk
		\item Legal and regulatory risk
		\item Operational risk
		\item Strategic risk
	\end{enumerate}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Theoretical considerations
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Assumptions of hedging: perfect competitive capital markets;
			\end{itemize}
			\item Disadvantages:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Cost management's focus on core business
				\item Compliance costs
